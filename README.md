# Open AI Caribbean Challenge: Mapping Disaster Risk from Aerial Imagery 

We, Team 6, participated in the Driven Data Competition, "Open AI Caribbean Challenge: Mapping Disaster Risk from Aerial Imagery" hosted by MathWorks. The Objective of the project was to come up with a method to extract the rooftops from the given GeoTIFF images and the rooftop co-ordinated within the GeoJSON files, and classify those images into five different classes [concrete_cement, healthy_metal, incomplete, irregular_metal, other].
